"C" - The C Programming Language (sometimes referred to as K&R, after its authors' initials) is a well-known computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the         latter of whom originally designed and implemented the language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely intertwined. The       book was central to the development and popularization of the C programming language and is still widely read and used today. Because the book was co-authored by the original language     designer, and because the first edition of the book served for many years as the de facto standard for the language, the book was regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on     C.

"Java" - Java is a functional computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as                possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on a            nother. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

"Objective-C" - Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. It is the main programming language               used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operating systems, and their respective application programming interfaces (APIs), Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.                   

"C++" - C++ (pronounced cee plus plus) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for      low-level memory manipulation.

"C#" - C# (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based),      and     component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC                   23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
       C# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.

"PHP" - PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. As of January 2013, PHP was installed on more than 240        million websites (39% of those sampled) and 2.1 million web servers. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the reference implementation of PHP (powered by the Zend                 Engine) is now produced by The PHP Group. While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, it now stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, which is a recursive backronym.

"JavaScript" - JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/; JS) is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts             to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. It is also used in server-side network                        programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.
               JavaScript is classified as a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing and first-class functions. This mix of features makes it a multi-paradigm language,
               supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

"Python" - Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to                           express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both                 a small and large scale.

"Perl" - Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl 6.
         The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell scripting (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without the
         arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a 
         CGI scripting language, in part due to its parsing abilities.

"PL/SQL" - PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle Corporation's procedural language extension for SQL and the Oracle relational database. PL/SQL is available in             Oracle Database (since version 7), TimesTen in-memory database (since version 11.2.1), and IBM DB2 (since version 9.7). Oracle Corporation usually extends PL/SQL functionality             with each successive release of the Oracle Database.
           PL/SQL includes procedural language elements such as conditions and loops. It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variables of those
           types, and triggers. It can handle exceptions (runtime errors). Arrays are supported involving the use of PL/SQL collections. Implementations from version 8 of Oracle Database 
           onwards have included features associated with object-orientation. One can create PL/SQL units such as procedures, functions, packages, types, and triggers, which are stored in
           the database for reuse by applications that use any of the Oracle Database programmatic interfaces.
